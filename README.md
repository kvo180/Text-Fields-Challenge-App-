# Text-Fields-Challenge-App-
This app was built as a part of Udacity's UIKit Fundamentals Course to demonstrate the concept of delegates
in Swift. It consists of 3 UITextFields that each have their own delegates and behaviors. The first text 
field limits user input to 5 digits for a zip code, the second formats the user input into a US currency,
and the third includes a UISwitch that manages whether the text field is enabled or disabled.
